. all numbers in  the "preferences" section must be in seconds ex: "time_delay=0.5" "0.5" as in half a second.
. settings will be ran when you press "start" in the AFKTool program.
. you're INI file must have a "preferences" section and a "commands" section the AFKTool program will search for this the only contents in the preferences section must only be a "time_delay" variable and a "hold_key_time" variable
. the commands must only be keyboard buttons such as "a,b,c,1,2,3" this is not a autoclicker.

. STRUCTURE

[preferences]
time_delay=0.5
hold_key_time=0.5

[commands]
key1=w
key2=a
key3=s
key4=d

. CONCLUSION

all INI files must have 2 sections a "preferences" section and a "commands" section the preferences section must only have 2 variable "time_delay" and "hold_key_time" the only thing you should be editing here are the time values (how often the keyboard keys are pressed and the time in beweeen that), commands section is free to edit as it will be they keyboard keys pressed when AFKTool is ran.
