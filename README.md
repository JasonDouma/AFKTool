**Don't want to get kicked for being AFK again?** With this software, you can easily deter that from happening by using our premade profiles or creating your own in the profile-settings folder.

**How This Works**
This program works by reading the contents of the currently selected profile (**.INI**) file. Then it uses the "Keyboard" library to control the current keyboard to use the information stored inside the file to move your in-game character.
